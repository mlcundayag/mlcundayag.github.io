## Description
In this challenge I have to create a portfolio page without any starter code using HTML and CSS. I used multiple resources from the internet in helping me build this web page. I also incorporated key lessons I learned from this course such as flexbox, media queries, and CSS variables. 

The contents of the webpage are as follows:

* Header
The Header is comprise of my avatar, a nav link to the body sections and a title of my webpage and the purpose. I used flex to fix spacing and display on my navigation links as well as my main top section for my page title and images. I also used advanced CSS to add an image as background. There are also links with hover effect that will take you to specifc sections on the webpage. 
* Body
The body of my webpage is divded into three main sections:
  - About me: which includes a write up about myself and a simple image
  - Recent works: I used box sizing method to contain the images with a main big image of my most recent works
  - Contact me: This section includes a form with proper input and label for name, email and a brief message. This also contains a submit button   
* Footer 

I then used media queries to make my website layout appear readable and appealing on any smaller screens or mobile device.
